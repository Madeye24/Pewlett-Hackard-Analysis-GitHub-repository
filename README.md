# RESULTS:

* Based on first analysis:
* 
1.we find the number of retiring people by their title, that actually helps PH to decide how many new employees will be recruited based on the number of people leaving the company.

2.This data helps the PH future-proof the company by planning ahead and start with the recruting process as in when the employees retire or take voluntary retirement.

* Based on second analysis:

1.we analysed how many and who will be a best suit for the mentorship program based on title and experience.

2.retirement_titles, unique_titles, retiring_titles, and mentorship_eligibilty table would provide all the information thats needed for the management to make a plan to future proof the company

# Summary:
At the moment at Pewlett Hackard, 64% of their employees are getting ready for retirement or being redirected to their mentorship initiatives.

Which means that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years.

Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come. 

For further studies, We should find, how many employees will be retiring per department, as each department will be affected differently, and for the mentorship program we can run a query that finds all the senior staff that will be helpful in identifying the experienced staff needed to train the next set of employees.
